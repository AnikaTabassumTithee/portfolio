        <p><b>“Suffering has been stronger than all other teaching, and has taught me to understand what your heart used to be."<br>
               -Charles Dickens, Great Expectations<br>
 
                <br>“For deep love unsatisfied is the hell of noble hearts and a portion of the accursed, but love that is mirrored back more perfect from the soul of our desired doth fashion wings to lift us above ourselves, and makes us what we might be.”<br>
                        ― H. Rider Haggard<br>

 

 

                 <br>“Wealth is good, and if it comes our way we will take it; but a gentleman does not sell himself for wealth.” <br>
                     ― H. Rider Haggard, King Solomon's Mines<br>

                  <br>“Truly wealth, which men spend all their lives in acquiring, is a valueless thing at the last.” <br>
                      ― H. Rider Haggard, King Solomon's Mines<br>


                    <br>“Listen! What is life? It is a feather, it is the seed of the grass, blown hither and thither, sometimes multiplying itself and dying in the act, sometimes carried away into the heavens. But if that seed be good and heavy it may perchance travel a little way on the road it wills. It is well to try and journey one's road and to fight with the air. Man must die. At the worst he can but die a little sooner.” <br>
                        ― H. Rider Haggard, King Solomon's Mines<br>
 

              <br>  “Truly the universe is full of ghosts, not sheeted churchyard spectres, but the inextinguishable elements of individual life, which having once been, can never die, though they blend and change, and change again for ever.” <br>
― H. Rider Haggard, King Solomon's Mines<br>
 

                      <br>“Women love the last blow as well as the last word, and when they fight for love they are pitiless as a wounded buffalo.” <br>
                           ― H. Rider Haggard, Allan Quatermain<br>

 

 

 

             <br> “Memory haunts me from age to age, and passion leads me by the hand--evil have I done, and with sorrow have I made acquaintance from age to age, and from age to age evil shall I do, and sorrow shall I know till my redemption comes.” <br>
                   ― H. Rider Haggard, She<br>


                      <br> “And now let us love and take that which is given us, and be happy; for in the grave there is no love and no warmth, nor any touching of the lips. Nothing perchance, or perchance but bitter memories of what might have been.” <br>
                              ― H. Rider Haggard, She<br>


            <br>  “Shall a man grave his sorrows upon a stone when he hath but need to write them on the water? Nay, oh /She/, I will live my day, and grow old with my generation, and die my appointed death, and be forgotten.” <br>
                ― H. Rider Haggard, She<br>

          <br> “The moon went slowly down in loveliness; she departed into the depth of the horizon, and long veil-like shadows crept up the sky through which the stars appeared."<br>
                  - H. Rider Haggard, She<br>

            <br> “Be careful when power comes to thee also, lest thou too shouldst smite in thine anger or thy jealousy, for unconquerable strength is a sore weapon in the hands of erring man” <br>
                             ― H. Rider Haggard, She<br>
 
    <br>    “We were like confirmed opium-eaters: in our moments of reason we well knew the deadly nature of our pursuit, but we certainly were not prepared to abandon its terrible delights.” <br>
             ― H. Rider Haggard, She<br>
 
            <br> “I am not proud, but I am happy; and happiness blinds, I think, more than pride.” <br>
                  ― Alexandre Dumas, The Count of Monte Cristo<br>

            <br>  “Woman is sacred; the woman one loves is holy.” <br>

      <br> “True love always makes a man better, no matter what woman inspires it.” <br>
                     ― Alexandre Dumas<br>

          <br>  “All human wisdom is contained in these two words - Wait and Hope” 
               ― Alexandre Dumas, The Count of Monte Cristo<br>


        <br> “Life is a storm, my young friend. You will bask in the sunlight one moment, be shattered on the rocks the next. What makes you a man is what you do when that storm comes.” <br>
           ― Alexandre Dumas<br>

 
        <br>  “It's necessary to have wished for death in order to know how good it is to live.” <br>
               ― Alexandre Dumas, The Count of Monte Cristo<br>

        <br>  “For all evils there are two remedies - time and silence.” <br>
          ― Alexandre Dumas, The Count of Monte Cristo<br>

 
        <br> “Learning does not make one learned: there are those who have knowledge and those who have understanding. The first requires memory and the second philosophy” <br>
                   ― Alexandre Dumas<br>

        <br> “Women are never so strong as after their defeat.” <br>
          ― Alexandre Dumas, Queen Margot, or Marguerite de Valois<br>

 
      <br>  “All for one and one for all.” <br>
                  ― Alexandre Dumas, The Three Musketeers<br>

 
<br>  “Music expresses that which cannot be put into words and that which cannot remain silent” <br>
― Victor Hugo<br>

<br>“What Is Love? I have met in the streets a very poor young man who was in love. His hat was old, his coat worn, the water passed through his shoes and the stars through his soul” <br>
― Victor Hugo, Les Misérables<br>

 <br>“Love is like a tree: it grows by itself, roots itself deeply in our being and continues to flourish over a heart in ruin. The inexplicable fact is that the blinder it is, the more tenacious it is. It is never stronger than when it is completely unreasonable.” <br>
― Victor Hugo, The Hunchback of Notre-Dame<br>

 <br> “The power of a glance has been so much abused in love stories, that it has come to be disbelieved in. Few people dare now to say that two beings have fallen in love because they have looked at each other. Yet it is in this way that love begins, and in this way only.” <br>
― Victor Hugo, Les Misérables<br>

<br>  “To love another person is to see the face of God.” <br>
                 ― Victor Hugo, Les Misérables<br>

                ― Victor Hugo, Les Misérables<br>

             ― Victor Hugo, Les Misérables<br>
