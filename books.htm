          <h style="color:darkblue"><b>Tess Of The D'urbervilles :</b></h>
          <p>Tess Durbeyfield is a (totally and completely doomed) country girl living in the late 19th Century in an English village that seems secluded, even though it's only a four-hour journey from London. Her father learns in the first chapter that he is the last lineal descendent of the D'Urbervilles—one of the oldest, most aristocratic, families in all of England. He foolishly assumes that his aristocratic heritage will suffice to pull his family out of poverty, and so he sends Tess off to "claim kin" (i.e., to borrow money on the strength of their distant family ties) from a wealthy branch of the D'Urbervilles. Tess is a very pretty girl, and very "womanly" for her age, and the son of the wealthy D'Urbervilles, Alec, tries to seduce her. He finds her too proud and modest to fall into his snares, and so he tricks her into accepting a ride from him back to the family house at night, and cuts through the woods. After getting lost (possibly on purpose), Alec leaves Tess to fall asleep under a tree while he tries to find the path. He comes back, and, finding her asleep, takes advantage of their solitude to rape her under the trees.The next phase of the book ("Maiden No More") opens with Tess back at her parents' house in the village of Marlott. She's had a baby as a result of her connection with Alec, and has secluded herself from her former friends out of a combination of shame and pride. She works a few odd jobs to make money, and things are going okay until her baby suddenly gets sick... and dies. Tess is more worried about the baby's soul than anything else, so she buries it in the churchyard on the sly.Time passes, and most of her friends and neighbors have forgotten about Tess's troubles. But she hasn't, so she decides to go to a neighboring county to work at a dairy farm where nobody knows her. One of the other workers at the dairy, Angel Clare, is the son of a gentleman. Angel is learning about farming so that he can move to the colonies in America and become a wealthy farmer there. He and Tess gradually fall in love.Tess wants to tell Angel about her past, but she can't bring herself reveal it to him. Finally, the night before they're supposed to get married, she slips a note under his door confessing everything. When he doesn't say anything about it the next morning, she assumes all is forgiven—but really, he never saw the note..........</p><br>

          <h style="color:darkblue"><b>Robin Hood :</b></h>
          <p>In the late twelfth century, King Richard the Lionhearted of England is fighting in the Holy Crusades, leaving the Regency of the Kingdom to his trusted friend, Longchamps. When Richard is captured by Leopold of Austria, Richard's brother, the treacherous Prince John, with help from his supportive Norman barons and his primary henchman Sir Guy of Gisbourne, seizes control of the Regency. Under the guise of getting money to free Richard, John, in pillaging from the Saxon commoners, uses the money instead to fatten his own coffers in gaining control of the throne. The Saxons turn to one of their own, Sir Robin of Locksley - also known as Robin Hood - who, often recklessly, fights on their behalf against Norman authority in an effort to restore what is rightfully the Saxons until Richard's return, Richard to who Robin is loyal. As such, Robin is viewed as an outlaw by Prince John and Sir Guy. Robin's refuge is Sherwood Forest, where he recruits men to fight for what he believes is right. Generally matching Robin's happy-go-lucky temperament, that band of merry men includes Will Scarlet, John Little (renamed Little John because of his hulking physical size), and Friar Tuck. Also seeing Robin and his men as outlaws is Lady Marian Fitzswalter, a Norman and a royal ward. It isn't until Marian meets Robin and sees first hand what he is doing that she changes her allegiances. Prince John and Sir Guy hope to use what they see as the growing attraction between Robin and Marian to capture Robin and sentence him to death. Robin and Marian, the latter she believes clandestinely, work against Prince John and Sir Guy until King Richard's return, when they hope all will be right with England. But the return of King Richard, if it does happen, does not automatically restore him to the throne, especially if Prince John can crown himself king in Richard's absence.</p><br>

          <h style="color:darkblue"><b>The Lady Of Blossholme :</b></h>
          <p>The Lady of Blossholme" was Henry Rider Haggard's 34th piece of fiction, out of an eventual 58 titles. It is a novel that he wrote (or, to be technically accurate, dictated) in the year 1907, although it would not see publication until the tail end of 1909, and is one of the author's more straightforward historical adventures, with hardly any fantasy elements to speak of. The story takes place in England during the reign of Henry VIII, in the year 1536. This was the period when King Henry was rebelling against Pope Clement VII, and when many Englishmen in the north, and many clergymen, were consequently rebelling against Henry, in the so-called Pilgrimage of Grace. To raise needed funds for this rebellion against the king, the Spanish abbot Clement Maldon murders Cicely Foterell's father and tries to claim all the family's lands and jewels. And what a hell this religious zealot puts poor Cicely through. She and her foster mother, Emlyn, are incarcerated in a nunnery and later tried as witches. Cicely's husband is conked on the head and shipped overseas, and a murderous midwife is sent to do away with Cicely's new baby. Before all can be put to rights, and our heroine and her husband are reunited, Cicely and her few friends must seek an audience with no less personages than Thomas Cromwell and King Henry themselves.</p><br>

          <h style="color:darkblue"><b>Pearl Maiden :</b></h>
          <p>The book starts out with a two Christian ladies that are very, very different. Nehushta was dark-skinned and in her 40s and Rachel was a pregnant pale-skinned 20-year-old. But despite their differences they are both great friends. But the situation they were in wasn’t so great. They were about to enter a roman amphitheater where several lions would devour them and they’re friends. When the roman emperor became sick, everything became chaos and the two ladies broke free. They hid in a merchant’s storehouse and then snuck away on a ship. The ship got stuck in a storm and Nehushta and Rachel were the only survivors. Rachel gave birth to a little girl, after the ship landed on the beach, and named her Miriam. She died quickly right after giving birth to the child and made Nehushta promise that Miriam would marry a Christian. Nehushta took Miriam to live with her uncle an Essene. Her uncle took her in but only under the commitment that she would leave when she turned eighteen. Miriam grew up with only one other child her age a young Jewish boy name Caleb. When she turned 14 Caleb started harrowing her to marry him, which shocked her. She told him she couldn’t marry him for two reasons, one because she did not love him and the other because he was not a Christian. But that did not stop him in the least from trying to make her love him back. One day a group of roman guards came by and took all of the Essenes sheep. Caleb was enraged and since the Essenes didn’t do anything about it he decided he would and killed one of the roman guards as they were leaving. This caused even more trouble because more roman guards came to investigate the murder. The roman captain, Marcus, walked in on Miriam while she was having her sculpting her lesson. He decided that she was a talented sculptor and asked her if she could do a bust of him. For the rest of the time he was there every afternoon she would sculpt him. They got to know each other pretty well. It didn’t take Marcus to long before he discovered that Caleb killed the guard. The night before he left he told Miriam he knew who had killed the guard. Miriam begged him not to hurt Caleb and he promised not to kill him. The night before Marcus left he told Miriam that he loved her. Miriam told him that she loved him to but couldn’t marry him because he wasn’t Christian. After Miriam went inside Caleb confronted Marcus and challenged him to a duel. Marcus refused and Caleb called him a coward. Of course being a guy he had to turn around and fight. There were many close calls for Marcus but eventually he got Caleb cornered and Caleb ran away but not totally, he left a finger. The next morning Marcus rode away with his bust and Caleb disappeared without a trace. But Marcus didn’t go straight home. Instead he went to Miriam’s grandfather, a Jew, and made him promise that if Miriam ever came to live with him that he wouldn’t force her to marry anyone. Benoni, Miriam’s grandfather, promised never to force her to marry anyone, but only because of the considerable debts he owed Marcus. It was a good thing that Marcus did what he did when he did because Caleb, now a rich gallant gentlemen, soon became fast friends with Benoni. Soon after when Miriam turned eighteen she and Nehushta moved in with Benoni. Benoni didn’t force Miriam to marry Caleb but he sure did try to convince her that she should marry Caleb. Miriam and Marcus wrote to each other but they didn’t receive each other’s letters very often. One day Miriam was in her grandfather’s gardens and a messenger came up to her and gave her a package from Marcus. Marcus gave her a necklace of pearls and an emerald ring with his profile carved into it. That night as she showed Nehushta the letter and jewelry, Nehushta informed her that Caleb and Benoni’s other friends were having a meeting and Benoni wanted her to meet them. Miriam was upset; she didn’t want to see Caleb. But she obeyed her grandfather. Miriam talked to Marcus a little, but all he talked about were the wars he was fighting against Rome. Miriam left supper early saying that she didn’t feel good. In the coming years the war between the Jews and the Romans got worse, and her Grandfather got more and more involved. He got so involved that the Romans eventually attacked his own house. Miriam, Nehushta, and Benoni all got away. They escaped to Jerusalem where Miriam got separated from her grandfather and happened upon the Essenes, who were hiding in a series of tunnels underneath the ground. Miriam wondered around daily, and one day she discovered a door that led to an old ruined tower where every day watched the happenings of the war. One day she saw Marcus riding on a horse directing battle against Caleb. One day Marcus fell off his horse and Caleb immediately charged him. Then Caleb challenged Marcus to a duel and once again Marcus said no and walked away. While Marcus’ back was turned Caleb hit him on the back with the side of his sword. Marcus fell to the ground and realized that his sword was gone and rushed straight for Caleb.........</p><br>

          <h style="color:darkblue"><b>A Tale Of Two Cities :</b></h>
          <p>It was the best of times, it was the worst of times," Charles Dickenswrites in the opening lines of A Tale of Two Cities as he paints a picture of life in England and France. The year is late 1775, and Jarvis Lorry travels from London to Paris on a secret mission for his employer, Tellson's Bank. Joining him on his journey is Lucie Manette, a 17-year-old woman who is stunned to learn that her father, Doctor Alexandre Manette, is alive and has recently been released after having been secretly imprisoned in Paris for 18 years. When Mr. Lorry and Lucie arrive in Paris, they find the Doctor's former servant, Ernest Defarge, caring for him. Defarge now runs a wine-shop with his wife in the poverty-stricken quarter of Saint Antoine. Defarge takes Mr. Lorry and Lucie to the garret room where he is keeping Doctor Manette, warning them that the Doctor's years in prison have greatly changed him. Thin and pale, Doctor Manette sits at a shoemaker's bench intently making shoes. He barely responds to questions from Defarge and Mr. Lorry, but when Lucie approaches him, he remembers his wife and begins to weep. Lucie comforts him, and that night Mr. Lorry and Lucie take him to England.Five years later, the porter for Tellson's Bank, Jerry Cruncher, takes a message to Mr. Lorry who is at a courthouse. Mr. Lorry has been called as a witness for the trial of Charles Darnay, a Frenchman accused of being a spy for France and the United States. Also at the trial are Doctor Manette and Lucie, who are witnesses for the prosecution. Doctor Manette has fully recovered and has formed a close bond with his daughter.If found guilty of treason, Darnay will suffer a gruesome death, and the testimony of an acquaintance, John Barsad, and a former servant, Roger Cly, seems sure to result in a guilty verdict. Questions from Darnay's attorney, Mr. Stryver, indicate that Cly and Barsad are the real spies, but the turning point in the trial occurs when Sydney Carton, Stryver's assistant, points out that Carton and Darnay look alike enough to be doubles. This revelation throws into doubt a positive identification of Darnay as the person seen passing secrets, and the court acquits Darnay. After the trial, Darnay, Carton, and Stryver begin spending time at the Manette home, obviously attracted to Lucie's beauty and kind nature. Stryver decides to propose to her, but is dissuaded by Mr. Lorry. Carton confesses his love to Lucie, but does not propose, knowing that his drunken and apathetic way of life is not worthy of her. However, he vows that he would gladly give his life to save a life she loved, and Lucie is moved by his sincerity and devotion. Eventually, it is Darnay whose love Lucie returns, and the two marry with Doctor Manette's uneasy blessing. While the couple is on their honeymoon, the Doctor suffers a nine-day relapse of his mental incapacity and believes he is making shoes in prison again......</p><br>

          <h style="color:darkblue"><b>The Count Of Monte Cristo :</b></h>
          <p>handsome, promising young sailor, skillfully docks the three-masted French ship, the Pharaon, in Marseilles after its captain died en route home. As a reward, Dantès is promised a captainship, but before he can claim his new post and be married to his fiancée, Mercédès', a conspiracy of four jealous and unsavory men arrange for him to be seized and secretly imprisoned in solitary confinement in the infamous Chateau d'If, a prison from which no one has ever escaped. The four men responsible are:<br>
           1.Fernand Mondego, who is jealous of Mercédès' love for Dantès;<br>
 

           2.Danglars, the purser of the Pharaon, who covets Dantès promised captainship;<br>

 

           3.Caderousse, an unprincipled neighbor; and<br>

 

           4.Villefort, a prosecutor who knows that Dantès is carrying a letter addressed to Villefort's father; the old man is a                              Bonapartist who would probably be imprisoned by the present royalist regime were it not for his son's, Villefort's, influence. Villefort fears, however, that this letter might damage his own position, and so he makes sure, he thinks, that no one ever hears about either Dantès or the letter again.<br>

For many years, Dantès barely exists in his tiny, isolated cell; he almost loses his mind and his will to live until one day he hears a fellow prisoner burrowing nearby. He too begins digging, and soon he meets an old Abbé who knows the whereabouts of an immense fortune, one that used to belong to an immensely wealthy Italian family. Dantès and the Abbé continue digging for several years, and from the Abbé, Dantès learns history, literature, science, and languages, but when at last they are almost free, the Abbé dies. Dantès hides his body, then sews himself in the Abbé's burial sack. The guards arrive, carry the sack outside, and heave the body far out to sea.Dantès manages to escape and is picked up by a shipful of smugglers, whom he joins until he can locate the island where the treasure is hidden. When he finally discovers it, he is staggered by the immensity of its wealth. And when he emerges into society again, he is the very rich and very handsome Count of Monte Cristo.Monte Cristo has two goals — to reward those who were kind to him and his aging father, and to punish those responsible for his imprisonment. For the latter, he plans slow and painful punishment. ......</p>
